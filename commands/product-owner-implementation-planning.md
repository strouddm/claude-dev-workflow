## What Product Owners DO NOT Specify

Leave these to the Software Engineer:
- ❌ Technical architecture or design patterns
- ❌ Programming languages or frameworks
- ❌ Database schemas or API designs
- ❌ Code structure or file organization
- ❌ Technical implementation approaches
- ❌ Specific libraries or tools
- ❌ Performance targets in milliseconds
- ❌ Technical integration details

## Output Example Comparison

### ✅ Good Product Owner Output:
- "Users need to start workouts with voice commands"
- "Response should feel conversational and natural"
- "Users expect it to work in a home environment"
- "Success means 80% of users complete setup on first try"

### ❌ Avoid Technical Specifications:
- "Use Flutter 3.x with speech_to_text package"
- "Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data"
- "Response time must be <800ms"
- "Use provider pattern for state management"

## Best Practices

### 1. Think Business First
- What problem are we solving?
- Who benefits and how?
- What's the return on investment?
- How does this advance our strategy?

### 2. Be the User's Voice
- What would delight users?
- What would frustrate them?
- What's the minimum acceptable experience?
- How do users define success?

### 3. Set Clear Boundaries
- What's included vs. excluded
- What can wait for later
- What dependencies exist
- What risks should we consider

### 4. Define Measurable Success
- User behavior metrics
- Business outcome metrics
- Quality indicators
- Satisfaction measures

### 5. Enable Engineering Creativity
- State the problem, not the solution
- Define constraints, not implementations
- Specify outcomes, not methods
- Trust technical expertise

## Remember

Your role as Product Owner is to:
1. **Champion user needs** - Be the voice of the user
2. **Define business value** - Explain why this matters
3. **Set clear requirements** - What success looks like
4. **Establish priorities** - What's most important
5. **Maintain clear communication** - Ensure smooth handoffs
6. **Leave implementation to experts** - Trust your engineers

The implementation plan should give engineers complete clarity on WHAT to build and WHY, while giving them freedom to determine HOW to build it.
