# Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Enhanced Project Context Integration

### 🚀 Major Features Added

**Automatic Project Context Integration**
- All agents now automatically load project-specific context
- Agents use your PRD, tech stack, coding standards, and project charter
- No more manual context copying or inconsistent decisions

**New `cproject` Command**
- One-command project setup with templates
- Creates complete project structure with customizable templates
- Auto-configures environment variables for seamless workflow

**Enhanced Agent Intelligence**
- **Product Owner**: Plans aligned with actual business requirements
- **Engineer**: Code follows your established tech stack and patterns  
- **Manager**: Reviews against your specific quality standards

### 🔧 Installation Improvements

**Consolidated Installation**
- Single `install.sh` script replaces multiple installers
- Automatic project directory creation
- Built-in template copying and environment setup

**Improved Documentation**
- Updated `QUICK-START.md` with project context walkthrough
- New `PROJECT-CONTEXT-GUIDE.md` for advanced setup
- Enhanced `README.md` with streamlined installation

### 📊 New Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cproject <name>` | Setup project with templates and context |
| Enhanced `cstatus` | Shows active project and workflow status |

### 🔄 Breaking Changes

- **Install process changed**: Use `install.sh` instead of `install-commands.sh`
- **New project setup**: Run `cproject [name]` after installation
- **Environment variables**: Auto-configured during project setup

### 🏗️ Architecture Updates

**Project Context Loading**
- Automatic detection via environment variables or git repo
- Fallback mechanisms for seamless operation
- Context injection into all agent prompts

**Enhanced Workflow**
1. Setup project once with `cproject`
2. All subsequent commands use project context automatically
3. Consistent decisions across entire team
